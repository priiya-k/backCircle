## 🛤️ Routes 

### index.ts
The `appRouter.ts` file serves as the central routing hub for the backend system. It imports individual route modules and then associates them with specific base paths using the Express `Router`. This modular approach helps in organizing the application routes, making it easier to maintain and extend the system.


```
import { Router } from "express";
import tradeRouter from "./trade.routes";
import cargoRouter from "./cargo.routes";
import inventoryRouter from "./inventory.routes";
import updatesRouter from "./updates.routes";

const appRouter = Router();

appRouter.use("/trades", tradeRouter);
appRouter.use("/cargo", cargoRouter);
appRouter.use("/inventory", inventoryRouter);
appRouter.use("/updates", updatesRouter);

export default appRouter;

```

## Overview of other Route Files in the Backend System 🗂️

In this backend system, each route file is designed to handle specific operations related to a particular domain, such as trade transactions, cargo management, or inventory tracking. This modular approach keeps the code organized, with each file focusing on a distinct set of endpoints and their corresponding operations.

### Example: `cargo.routes.ts`

The `cargo.routes.ts` file is responsible for defining and handling routes related to cargo operations. Each route corresponds to a specific HTTP method and endpoint, designed to perform an action like retrieving, updating, or managing cargo data.


```

const cargoRouter = Router();

cargoRouter.get("/", getAllCargos);
cargoRouter.get("/:shipmentId", getCargoById);
cargoRouter.put("/update/:shipmentId", updateCargo);

export default cargoRouter;

```

## How Routes Interact with Controllers in the Backend System

In this backend system, each route defined in the routing files (`cargo.routes.ts`, `trade.routes.ts`, etc.) is connected to a controller function located in the `controllers` directory. These controller functions handle the core operations, such as interacting with the database, processing data, and sending responses back to the client.

### Example: `cargo.controllers.ts` function 

```
export const updateCargo = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { shipmentId } = req.params;
  const updateData = req.body;

  try {
    const updatedCargo = await Cargo.findOneAndUpdate(
      { shipmentId },
      { $set: updateData },
      { new: true, runValidators: true }
    );

    if (!updatedCargo) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Cargo not found' });
    }

    cargoEventEmitter.emit('cargoUpdated', updatedCargo);

    return res.status(200).json({
      message: 'Cargo updated successfully',
      cargo: updatedCargo,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error updating cargo:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error updating cargo', error: (error as Error).message });
  }
};

```

## Event Processing in the Backend System 📡

### 1. Introduction to Event Emitters

In this backend system, we utilize Node.js's `EventEmitter` class to implement an event-driven architecture. The `eventEmitter.ts` file initializes an instance of `EventEmitter` that allows us to manage and process events, such as trade transactions and cargo updates, in real time.

### 2. EventEmitter Initialization

The `eventEmitter.ts` file is where the event emitter is initialized:

```
import EventEmitter from 'events';

const tradeEventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

export default tradeEventEmitter;

```

### a. Ingesting Events

When a trade transaction is initiated, an event is emitted to signal that a specific action needs to be performed, such as updating cargo information or adjusting inventory levels.

### b. Processing Events in Real-Time

The event emitter listens for these events and triggers associated callback functions that process the event data. This ensures that actions like updating the cargo status and inventory quantities happen immediately after a trade is initiated, maintaining consistency across the system.

### 4. Example: Handling a Trade Initiation Event

Below is an example of how `tradeEventEmitter` is used in conjunction with other components like the `Cargo` and `Inventory` models to process a trade event:

Same we have implemented for managing cargo where on updating some data on the cargo we call `cargoEventEmittter.ts` file. 

```
import tradeEventEmitter from './eventEmitter';
import Cargo from '../model/cargo';
import Inventory from '../model/inventory';

tradeEventEmitter.on('tradeInitiated', async (trade) => {
    try {
      const newCargo = new Cargo({
        shipmentId: `shipment-${trade.transactionId}`,
        origin: trade.seller,
        destination: trade.buyer,
        items: trade.items,
        status: 'pending',
        ETA: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) 
      });
  
      await newCargo.save();
  
      await Inventory.updateOne(
        { stationId: trade.buyer },
        {
          $inc: { quantity: trade.items.length },
          $addToSet: { items: { $each: trade.items } }
        }
      );
      
      // Update inventory for the seller
      await Inventory.updateOne(
        { stationId: trade.seller },
        {
          $inc: { quantity: -trade.items.length },
          $pullAll: { items: trade.items }
        }
      );
      console.log(`Cargo created and inventory updated for trade ${trade.transactionId}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error processing trade event:", error);
    }
});

```

## Understanding `updates.controllers.ts` 📡

### 1. Purpose of `updates.controllers.ts`

The `updates.controllers.ts` file is responsible for managing real-time updates in the system. It leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push real-time data from the server to the client whenever specific events occur, such as a trade initiation or a cargo update. This functionality is crucial for maintaining a live feed of updates, ensuring that users have the latest information without needing to constantly refresh the page.

### 2. Key Components of the File

#### a. Setting Up Server-Sent Events (SSE)

The `realTimeUpdateDetailFunction` sets up the connection for SSE. This allows the server to push updates directly to the client.

```
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');

// Send a message to confirm the connection is established
res.write('data: Connection established\n\n');

```

Access this endpoint via route 
```
 domain/api/updates/real-time/

```
## Importance: This mechanism ensures users receive immediate updates without needing to refresh the page, maintaining the integrity and responsiveness of the system.


 ## 🔍 Knowning  Limitations and Potential Improvements : 

### Known Limitations ->

- **Scalability**: The current implementation may encounter issues as the number of trades and cargo updates increases, especially with real-time features.
- **Single Database**: Using a single MongoDB instance could create bottlenecks. Sharding or replication might be needed for large-scale deployments.
-  **Secruity Vulnerabilities** : The system currently lacks advanced security measures, leaving it vulnerable to potential threats like unauthorized access and data breaches.
-  **Limited Real-Time Analytics** :  No real-time analytics for monitoring.

## Scalability and Performance Strategies : ->
## 1. Scaling Strategies
Horizontal Scaling: Deploy the backend system across multiple servers or containers to handle a large number of concurrent trade transactions. Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly.
Microservices Architecture: Break down the monolithic system into smaller, independent services (e.g., trade, cargo, inventory). This allows you to scale each service individually based on demand.
Database Sharding: Distribute your database across multiple servers to handle high data volumes. Sharding can help by splitting large collections into smaller, more manageable pieces.
## 2. Performance Optimization
Caching: Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces the load on your database and speeds up response times.
Data Partitioning: Partition large tables or collections into smaller chunks to improve query performance. Partitioning can be based on trade date, cargo type, or other relevant criteria.
Indexing: Create indexes on frequently queried fields in your database to speed up read operations. However, balance indexing with the impact it has on write performance.
Load Testing: Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate high loads and identify bottlenecks in the system.
### Potential Improvements ->

- **Caching**: As trade and cargo volume increases, consider sharding or replication for MongoDB.
- **Microservices Architecture**:Transitioning to a microservices architecture could enhance scalability and maintainability.
- **Robust Security** : Implement robust security protocols, including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits to safeguard the system.
